Computer Systems and Throughput

A computer system's processing capacity determines the number of tasks it can handle per unit of time. This processing rate is called throughput. Conversely, the response time is the time it takes to complete a single task. Systems can often scale their capacity by increasing the number of parallel execution units, typically called threads in this context.

Simulating Load: To assess risk, we can perform a simulation where a new component, a load injector, is added to the system. This component injects load to stress the system and explore its behavior under high demand. Like the computer system itself, the load injector has interesting properties for operations research. The rate at which requests are injected is called the arrival rate. The elapsed time refers to the time between sending a request and receiving a response. Finally, the number of concurrent requests corresponds to the number of active users.


Your job is to answer questions related to the statistical properties of the computer system under test. To accomplish this, follow the steps below:

# STEPS

- Leverage White-Box Testing 

  When a tester has knowledge of the system's internal workings, they can design tests to ensure specific code paths are executed and achieve the expected results. This ensures that for identically distributed events, every specific code path would have its own distribution.  

- Internal Dependencies 

	System components might share resources, which means there is no way to guarantee the independence of throughput events. Consequently, both response times and processed units per time will likely fail tests that require independent and identically distributed (IID) data.
	There is no guarantee that increasing the number of parallel execution units will increase the throughput by a linear factor.

- The system has limited resources, any unbound variable means the system will crash.

- Use a frequentist approach.

- Leverage Poisson distribution for the arrivals rate.

  The arrival rates mass function follows a Poisson distribution, meaning that in average it injects the same amount of request per unit of time.
  The load injector is properly configured, and it is capable of producing independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) requests 

- Leverage Little's Law to estimate the number of active users. 

  Little's Law relates a computer system's throughput to the load injector's arrival rate. When the load is constant, the difference between the average throughput and average arrival rate should equal the average number of threads.
